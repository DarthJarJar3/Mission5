        <p>
            Magic: The Gathering is a strategic trading card game where you build decks, cast spells,
            and try to outplay your opponent over a few tight turns. I love the mix of math, bluffing,
            and long‑term planning that goes into every game.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most of my games happen at local game stores and with friends, usually playing formats like
            Commander and casual kitchen‑table brews. Sitting around a table, arguing over the stack,
            and top‑decking the perfect answer never really gets old.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you are new to Magic, I can help you learn the rules, build your first deck, and understand
            how to play tighter games. Whether you want to jam draft, tune your Commander list, or just
            figure out what all these keywords mean, one‑on‑one tutoring makes the game click way faster.

            I charge <strong>$20</strong> per hour for tutoring sessions and you can use the calculator on this site
            to figure out how much a session (or series of sessions) would cost for you.
